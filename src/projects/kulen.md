## Branding

Kulen Outreach needed a logomark that reflected the curiousity and enthusiasm of the kids in Phnom Kulen. The mark pays homage to the Cambodian flag, honoring tradition and heritage, while looking to a future brightened by foundational learning. The color palette is a nod to the lychee fruit - the namesake of Phnom Kulen.

## Information Architecture & Visual Design

For an organization based in Cambodia, a website is an invaluable communication tool. Kulen Outreach's website was designed to facilitate easy access to information for potential donors and volunteers. High quality photography is featured on a large scale, giving users a sense of the real impact Kulen Outreach is making for the children of Phnom Kulen.
